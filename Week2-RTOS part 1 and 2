 Operating System such as Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and  IOS are categorised as general purpose OS.
 Design with human interaction as most important feature therefore scheduler cannot be known to people such as how long the task will be executed, when the task is being executed, in what order the task is being executed, etc.
RTOS same as GPOS but the scheduler can guarantee the timing of execution, how long the execution, etc.
Ability to run task simulataneously and meeting the timing are things that RTOS  has advantages over General OS
Task - piece of work done in code 
Thread - unit of CPU utilization with its own program counter and memory(stack)
process - instance computer program executed.
